# F# MVC Example App

Project setup:

You may need '''nunit test adapter 2.0''' to run the tests in MS Test Explorer (Ctrl R, A) since the Resharper test runner seems to be unable to display the names and output of the tests.


Additional configuration:

You need a client secret to connect, if you work at valtech you can get one from https://stage-id-admin.valtech.com/#/clients/valtech.idp.testclient.local/edit
